# Brain-Anomaly-Detection-

This project was part of a challenge competition focused on detecting brain anomalies from CT scans using
machine learning. The goal was to develop a system that could accurately differentiate between two types of
scans - normal ones and those with anomalies.

<ins>Dataset Description</ins>

The task is to discriminate between two classes of brain CT scans, one that contains anomalies (label 1) and one that is normal (class 0). Each sample is a grayscale image of 224x224 pixels. Each example is assigned to one of the two classes. The training set consists of 15,000 labeled examples. The validation set consists of 2,000 labeled examples. The test set consists of another 5,149 examples. The test labels are not provided with the data.
